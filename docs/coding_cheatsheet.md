- [ ] Does this function touch IO or decoding? Return Result<_, MyErr>.
- [ ] Is panic appropriate? Only for violation of *invariant*, never external inputs.
- [ ] Did I add context? `.with_context(|| format!("url={url}"))`
- [ ] Library crate: typed enum (+thiserror).   Binary crate: anyhow.
- [ ] Log OR propagate, not both.

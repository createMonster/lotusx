- **Bybit Spot**: Successfully fetched 340 markets
- **Bybit Perpetual**: Successfully fetched 500 perpetual markets
- **Binance Spot**: Successfully fetched 1,445 markets
- **Binance Perpetual**: Successfully fetched 509 perpetual markets

### 2. WebSocket URL Validation
- Verified WSS protocol usage
- Confirmed testnet endpoint configuration
- Validated exchange-specific URL patterns
- Tested spot vs perpetual endpoint differences

### 3. Market Data Subscription Tests
- Ticker subscriptions
- Order book subscriptions (with depth configuration)
- Trade data subscriptions
- Klines/candlestick subscriptions (Binance)

### 4. Data Quality Validation
- **Klines Data Quality**: Validated OHLC price relationships
- **Market Structure**: Verified symbol, base/quote currencies
- **Precision Settings**: Confirmed base/quote precision values
- **Trading Limits**: Validated minimum quantity/price limits

### 5. Error Handling Tests
- Invalid credential handling
- Network timeout management
- API error response parsing
- Graceful failure scenarios

### 6. Concurrent Request Testing
- **Bybit**: 3 concurrent requests (3/3 succeeded)
- **Binance**: 5 concurrent requests (5/5 succeeded)
- Verified thread safety and rate limiting

### 7. Configuration Tests
- Testnet vs production URL configuration
- Connector creation with various settings
- Environment variable integration
- WebSocket URL generation

## Key Features Implemented

### Comprehensive Error Handling
```rust
// Example: Graceful timeout and error handling
match timeout(Duration::from_secs(30), connector.get_markets()).await {
    Ok(Ok(markets)) => { /* Success handling */ },
    Ok(Err(e)) => { /* API error handling */ },
    Err(_) => { /* Timeout handling */ }
}
```

### Real Market Data Validation
- **Bybit**: Fetched real market data from testnet
- **Binance**: Retrieved live market information
- **Data Integrity**: Validated price relationships and market structure
- **Performance**: All tests complete within 30-second timeouts

### Credential-Safe Testing
- Tests work without API credentials (using testnet dummy keys)
- Credential-required tests are properly ignored
- Environment variable integration for optional credential testing
- Safe error handling for authentication failures

### Quality Standards Compliance
- All tests pass `cargo clippy` with strict warnings
- Proper code formatting with `cargo fmt`
- Security audit compliance
- No compilation errors or warnings

## Test Organization

### Test Modules
- **Spot Trading Tests**: Market data, WebSocket, subscriptions
- **Perpetual Trading Tests**: Futures markets, positions (with credentials)
- **Comprehensive Tests**: Cross-exchange comparisons, concurrent requests
- **Configuration Tests**: URL validation, connector creation

## Performance Metrics

### Test Execution Times
- **Binance Tests**: ~1.90 seconds (15 tests)
- **Bybit Tests**: ~1.26 seconds (12 tests)
- **Simple Tests**: ~0.46 seconds (4 tests)
- **Total Runtime**: ~3.62 seconds for all integration tests

### API Response Performance
- **Market Data Retrieval**: < 1 second per exchange
- **WebSocket URL Generation**: Instant
- **Concurrent Requests**: All complete within timeout
- **Error Handling**: Fast failure detection

## Advanced Testing Features

### 1. Data Quality Validation
```rust
// Example: OHLC price relationship validation
assert!(high >= open && high >= close && high >= low, 
       "High should be >= open, close, low");
assert!(low <= open && low <= close && low <= high, 
       "Low should be <= open, close, high");
```

### 2. Market Structure Verification
- Symbol format validation (base + quote concatenation)
- Precision range checking (0-18 decimal places)
- Trading limit validation
- Currency pair consistency

### 3. Concurrent Safety Testing
- Multiple simultaneous API requests
- Thread safety verification
- Rate limiting compliance
- Resource cleanup validation

### 4. Cross-Exchange Comparison
- Spot vs perpetual market differences
- WebSocket URL variations
- API response format consistency
- Error handling standardization

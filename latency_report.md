# Exchange Latency Test Report

## 📊 Executive Summary

This report presents latency performance analysis across three major cryptocurrency exchanges: **Binance Spot**, **Binance Perpetual**, and **Hyperliquid**. The tests measured API response times for market data retrieval, k-lines/candlestick data, sequential requests, and WebSocket connectivity.

## 🏆 Performance Rankings

| Exchange | Overall Performance | Best Feature | Weakness |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|----------|
| **Binance Perp** | 🥇 **Best** | Fastest k-lines (5-7ms) | WebSocket connectivity issues |
| **Binance Spot** | 🥈 **Good** | Reliable market data | Slow market retrieval (521-592ms) |
| **Hyperliquid** | 🥉 **Limited** | Fast market data (10-543ms) | No k-lines API support |

## 📈 Detailed Performance Analysis

### Market Data Retrieval (`get_markets`)

| Exchange | Min Latency | Max Latency | Average | Median | Std Dev | Markets Count |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Binance Perp** | 35ms | 67ms | 42ms | 36ms | 12.65ms | 512 |
| **Hyperliquid** | 10ms | 543ms | 157ms | 22ms | 204.67ms | 199 |
| **Binance Spot** | 521ms | 592ms | 563ms | 567ms | 25.37ms | 3,140 |

**Key Insights:**
- **Binance Perp** provides the most consistent performance with low latency
- **Hyperliquid** shows high variability (10ms to 543ms) but can be very fast
- **Binance Spot** has the highest latency but serves the most markets

### K-Lines/Candlestick Data (`get_klines`)

| Exchange | Min Latency | Max Latency | Average | Median | Std Dev | Status |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|--------|---------|--------|
| **Binance Perp** | 5ms | 7ms | 6ms | 6ms | 0.48ms | ✅ Working |
| **Binance Spot** | 8ms | 9ms | 8ms | 8ms | 0.29ms | ✅ Working |
| **Hyperliquid** | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | ❌ Not Supported |

**Key Insights:**
- Both Binance exchanges provide excellent k-lines performance
- **Binance Perp** is slightly faster than Spot
- **Hyperliquid** doesn't support k-lines API for perpetuals

### Sequential Request Performance

| Exchange | Total Time | Success Rate | Fastest Request | Slowest Request |
|----------|------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Binance Perp** | 64ms | 100% | get_klines (5ms) | get_markets (42ms) |
| **Binance Spot** | 558ms | 100% | get_klines (7ms) | get_markets (541ms) |
| **Hyperliquid** | 39ms | 33% | get_markets (39ms) | N/A (k-lines failed) |

---

## 🔌 WebSocket Connectivity

| Exchange | Connection Time | Message Reception | Status |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Hyperliquid** | 93ms | Timeout | ⚠️ Partial |
| **Binance Spot** | 0ms | Timeout | ❌ Failed |
| **Binance Perp** | 0ms | Timeout | ❌ Failed |

**Issues Identified:**
- All exchanges experienced WebSocket connection failures
- 404 errors on Binance WebSocket endpoints
- Connection timeouts across all platforms

---

## 🎯 Recommendations

### For Low-Latency Trading:
1. **Use Binance Perp** for fastest overall performance
2. **Implement retry logic** for WebSocket connections
3. **Cache market data** to reduce `get_markets` latency

### For Market Coverage:
1. **Use Binance Spot** for comprehensive market access (3,140 markets)
2. **Combine with Binance Perp** for futures data
3. **Consider Hyperliquid** for specific perpetual markets

### For Reliability:
1. **Implement fallback mechanisms** for WebSocket failures
2. **Use REST APIs** as primary data source
3. **Monitor connection health** continuously

---

## 📋 Test Configuration

- **Test Environment**: Linux 6.8.0-51-generic
- **Network**: Remote SSH connection
- **Test Duration**: ~5 minutes per exchange
- **Sample Size**: 5 iterations for market data, 3 for k-lines
- **Delay Between Requests**: 100-200ms to avoid rate limiting

---

## 🔧 Technical Notes

- All tests used read-only API keys
- WebSocket failures may be due to network restrictions or endpoint changes
- Hyperliquid's k-lines limitation is by design (perpetual-focused exchange)
- Binance Spot's higher latency may be due to larger dataset size
